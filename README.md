# New-Practice-Website

This is going to be the new website I am using to showcase my skills.

As of now I am going to create a website that contains:

A landing page

Maybe:

Comments
Pictures
Upload Capability 
Personal Accounts/Authentication

Could use express routing with premade objects and short term storage before learning and implementing mongoose/mongodb

What type of website this will be: (Still In Development)

Media Website? 
News type Website?
